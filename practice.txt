Here is a practice file for making changes and opening a PR.

Feel free to make edits and additions to the contents, or add some new files!

-------------------------

To review the process, here are the steps:
1. Fork the repo into your own account.
2. Clone your forked copy to your local machine to make edits.
3. Make changes.
4. Push changes to your own repo copy.
5. Open a PR.
6. A collaborator will review your requested changes and either make suggested edits or merge your changes in.

These steps could probably use a bit more detail... hint hint ;-)
