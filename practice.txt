Here is a practice file for making changes and opening a PR.

Feel free to make edits and additions to the contents, or add some new files!

-------------------------

To review the process, here are the steps:
1. Fork the repo into your own account.
2. Make changes. 
3. Open a PR.
4. A collaborator will review your requested changes and either make suggested edits or merge your changes in.

These steps could probably use a bit more detail... hint hint ;-)
